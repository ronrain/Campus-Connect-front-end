## What's CampusConnect All About? 🌟

CampusConnect is all about making life easier for college students. It's a place where you can find a wide range of services organized by categories like ✂️ haircut, 📚 tutoring, 🍳 cooking, and more. Plus, you can either offer your own services or book services offered by other students. It's a win-win!

## What Can You Do on CampusConnect? 💼

Here are some of the cool features you'll find on CampusConnect:

### Service Categories 🗂️

You can browse services by categories, making it super easy to find what you need. From academic help to personal services, we've got it all covered.

### Create and Book Services 📅

- **Create a Service:** If you've got a skill to offer, you can create a service listing. Tell everyone about your service, set your availability, 💰 price, and location.

- **Book a Service:** If you're on the hunt for a service, you can easily book services from other students. Check out all the details, see when they're available, and make your booking.

### Leave Reviews 🌟

We believe in trust and community. That's why we have a review system in place. After using a service, you can leave a review and rating to help others make informed choices.

We've got the basics covered with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations:
